Banana Bread (adapted from the St. Peter's Catholic Church Cookbook from my childhood)

1/2 cup butter (about half a 250g bar) softened
1 1/4 cup sugar (about 250 g)
2 eggs
1 1/2 cup flour (about 180 g)
3/4 tsp baking powder
2 1/2 tsp milk
1/2 tsp vinegar
1 tsp vanilla
1 cup mashed banana (about 3)
1 cup chopped walnuts (optional)

In medium mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar together.  Add eggs one at a time alternating with flour.
Mix baking powder, milk, and vinegar in a separate small bowl immediately before adding to the other mixture.
Add nuts, banana and vanilla.
Bake at 325F/<175C for 1 hour.

Hints:
Let butter sit out for several hours. The softer the butter the better it will mix.
Take bananas just as they are about to turn black and put them in the freezer.  They will be very soft when defrosted.
Line pan with aluminum foil for easy cleanup and a very crisp edge.

Substitutes:
Also acceptable with applesauce and cinnamon.
For a dairy-free version, substitute butter for a plant-based margarine and the milk for water. It won't rise as much but still tastes pretty good.
