Peach Crisp (origin unknown)

4-5 cups slides peaches
1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
1 cup plus 3 tbsp flour divided
1 cup outs
1 cup brown sugar
1 cup butter
3 tbsp white sugar

Preheat over to 350 degrees. Grease 9 x 13" pan. Mix peaches, cinnamon, white sugar, and 3 tbsp flour. Add to pan.

Mix the rest of the dry ingredients. Cut in butter. Sprinkle over the top of the pan.

Bake uncovered for about 45 minutes.

Hints:
Although the recipe calls for a 9 x 13" pan, I like my crisp a little thicker so I tend to use this amount in an 8x8 or round dish instead.

Substitutes:
Apples instead of peaches.
